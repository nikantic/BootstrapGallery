#Bootstrap Gallery
This is a demo of a Bootstrap image gallery without plugins.  See it live [here](https://nikantic.github.io/BootstrapGallery/)!

The modal is used to preview the image and go to the previous or the next one. It respects the height and the width of the image and aligns it in the center of the screen. There is also a quick toggle to show or hide the image information.
